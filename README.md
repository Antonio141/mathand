Welcome to mathhands! 
Solve as many equations as you can using your hands to get the highest number and beat the record!!!
How does it work:
1) Put yourself in front of the camera with your hands visible
2) In the screen will appear the equation that you have to solve 
3) Solve the equation in your mind and make the number using the fingers of both your hands 
4) Try to solve as many as you can
Good luck!!!
